## Encapsulation

1. Clone and pull down this repo
2. Encapsulate the methods better

## Add Jasmine to the project

1. Download Jasmine
2. Run it for the first time

## Write some Jasmine tests

1. Test to see if the button creates the localStorage array item
2. Test to see if the DOM element is added
3. Test to see if the button removes the item from the array
3. Test to see if the DOM no longer contains the element

## More practice available via a jsfiddle?
